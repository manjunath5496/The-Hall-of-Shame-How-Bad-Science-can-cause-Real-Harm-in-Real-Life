<p>We humans, who began as a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mineral</a>&nbsp;and then emerged into<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;plant</a>&nbsp;life and into the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">animal&nbsp;</a>state and then to being aggressive mortal beings who fought a survival struggle in caveman days, to get more food, territory or partner with whom to&nbsp;<strong>reproduce</strong>, now are glued to the TV set, marveling at the adventures of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">science</a>&nbsp;and their dazzling array of futuristic&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">technology</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">teleportation</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinesis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">telekinesis</a>:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">rocket</a>&nbsp;ships, fax machines,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">supercomputer</a>s, a worldwide communications network,&nbsp;<strong>gas-powered automobiles</strong>&nbsp;and high-speed elevated trains. The science has opened up an entirely new world for us. And our lives have become easier and more comfortable. With the help of science we have estimated about&nbsp;<strong>8,000 chemotherapeutic</strong>&nbsp;exogenous non-nutritive&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">chemical substance</a>s which when taken in the solid form by the mouth enter the digestive tract and there they are transformed into a solution and passed on to the liver where they are chemically altered and finally released into the blood stream. And through blood they reach the site of action and binds reversibly to the target cell surface receptors to produce their&nbsp;<strong>pharmacological</strong>&nbsp;effect. And after their pharmacological effect they slowly detaches from the&nbsp;<strong>receptor</strong>. And then they are sent to the liver. And there they are transformed into a more water soluble compound called metabolite and released from the body through urine, sweat, saliva, and excretory products. However, the long term use of chemotherapeutic&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">drug</a>s for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">disease</a>s like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cancer</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">diabetes&nbsp;</a>leads to side effects. And the side effects &mdash; including&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">nausea</a>, loss of hair, loss of strength, permanent organ damage to the heart, lung, liver, kidneys, or reproductive system etc. &mdash; are so severe that some&nbsp;<strong>patients</strong>&nbsp;rather die of disease than subjecting themselves to this torture.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Smallpox</a>&nbsp;(an acute contagious disease caused by the&nbsp;<strong>variola&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>virus</strong></a>, a member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopoxvirus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>orthopoxvirus</strong></a>&nbsp;family) was a leading cause of death in 18th century, and the inexorable spread of the disease reliably recorded the death rate of some hundred thousand people. And the death toll surpassed 5000 people a day. Yet&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Jenner" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Edward Jenner</a>, an English&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>physician</strong></a>, noticed something special occurring in his small&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">village</a>. People who were exposed to cowpox did not get smallpox when they were exposed to the disease. Concluding that cowpox could save people from smallpox, Edward purposely infected a young boy who lived in his village first with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowpox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cowpox</a>, then with smallpox. Fortunately, Edward's hypothesis worked well. He had successfully demonstrated the world's first vaccine and eradicated the disease. And&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">vaccine</a>s which once saved humanity from the smallpox (which was a leading cause of death in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">England</a>), now have associated with the outbreaks of diseases like&nbsp;<strong>pertussis&nbsp;</strong>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>whooping cough</strong></a>) which have begun showing up in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">United States</a>&nbsp;in the past forty years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1930s,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hermann_M%C3%BCller" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Paul Hermann Muller</strong></a>&nbsp;a research chemist at the firm of Geigy in Basel, with the help of science introduced the first modern insecticide (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DDT</a>:&nbsp;<strong>dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane</strong>) and it won him the 1948&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Nobel Prize</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Physiology</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Medicine</a>&nbsp;for its credit of saving thousands of human lives in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">World War II&nbsp;</a>by killing typhus-carrying lice and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">malaria</a>-carrying&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mosquito</a>es, dramatically reducing Malaria and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Yellow Fever</a>&nbsp;around the world. But in the late 1960s&nbsp;<strong>DDT</strong>&nbsp;which was a world saver was no longer in public favor &ndash; it was blamed moderately hazardous and&nbsp;<strong>carcinogenic</strong>. And most applications of DDT were banned in the U.S. and many other countries. However, DDT is still legally manufactured in the U.S., but only sold to foreign countries.</p>
<p>At a time when&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Napoleon</strong></a>&nbsp;was almost disturbing whole of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Europe</a>&nbsp;due to his aggressive policies and designs and most of the world was at war &ndash; the science gave birth to the many inventions which took place in the field of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>textile</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;industry</strong>&nbsp;and due to invention of steam engine and development of means of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">transport</a>ation and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">communication</a>. Though it gave birth in England, yet its inventions spread all over the world in a reasonably period. And rapid industrialization was a consequence of new&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">invention</a>s and demand for expansion of large industrial cities led to the large scale&nbsp;<strong>exploitation of agricultural land</strong>. And socio-economic growth was peaking, as industries were booming, and agricultural lands were decreasing, as the world enjoyed the fruits of the rapid&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">industrialization</a>. As a result of this, the world&rsquo;s population was growing at an exponential rate and the world's&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">food&nbsp;</a>supply was not in the pace of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">population</a>'s increase. And this resulted in widespread famine in many parts of the world, such as England, and as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">starvation</a>&nbsp;was rampant. In that time line,&nbsp;science suppressed that situation by producing more&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ammonia</a>&nbsp;through the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Haber Bosch Process&nbsp;</strong></a>(more ammonia, more&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fertilizer</a>s. more fertilizers, more food production). But at the same time, science which solved the world's hunger problems also led to the production of megatons of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">TNT</a>&nbsp;(<strong>trinitrotoluene</strong>) and other explosives which were dropped on all the cities leading to the death of some hundred million people.</p>
<p>Rapid industrialization which once raised the economic and living standard of the people has now become a&nbsp;<strong>major global issue</strong>. The full impact of an industrial&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fuel&nbsp;</a>economy has led to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">global warming</a>&nbsp;(i.e., the increase of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Earth</a>'s average&nbsp;<strong>surface&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>temperature</strong></a>&nbsp;due to effect of too much&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">carbon dioxide</a>&nbsp;emissions from industrial centers which acts as a blanket, trap heat and warm the planet). And as a result,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Greenland</a>'s ice shelves have started to shrink permanently, disrupting the world's weather by altering the flow of ocean and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_current" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">air current</a>s around the&nbsp;<strong>planet</strong>. And violent swings in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">climate</a>&nbsp;have started to appear in the form of floods, droughts, snow storms and&nbsp;<strong>hurricanes</strong>.</p>
<p>Industries are the main sources of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sulfur dioxide</a>&nbsp;emission and automobiles for nitrogen oxides. And the oxides of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">nitrogen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sulfur</a>&nbsp;combine with the moisture in the atmosphere to form acids. And these acids reach the&nbsp;<strong>Earth</strong>&nbsp;as rain, snow, or fog and react with minerals in the soil and release&nbsp;<strong>deadly toxins</strong>&nbsp;and affect a variety of plants and animals on the earth. And these acids damage buildings, historic&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>monuments</strong></a>, and statues, especially those made of rocks, such as limestone and marble, that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">acid rain</a>&nbsp;has reacted with the marble (calcium carbonate) of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Taj Mahal</strong></a>&nbsp;(an ivory-white&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">marble</a>&nbsp;mausoleum on the south bank of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Yamuna</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;river</strong>&nbsp;in the Indian city of Agra) causing immense damage to this wonderful structure (i.e., Taj is changing color).</p>
<p>Science once introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">refrigerator</a>s for prolonging storage of food but now refrigerators are the active sources of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">chlorofluorocarbon</a>s (<strong>CFC</strong>) which interact with the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">UV</a>&nbsp;light during which chlorine is separated. And this chlorine in turn destroys a significant amount of the ozone in the high atmosphere admitting an intense dose of&nbsp;<strong>harmful ultraviolet radiation</strong>. And the increased ultraviolet flux produces the related health effects of skin&nbsp;<strong>cancer</strong>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cataract</a>s, and immune suppression and produces a permanent change in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">nucleotide</a>sequence and lead to changes in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">molecule</a>s the cell produce, which modify and ultimately affect the process of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>photosynthesis</strong></a>&nbsp;and destroy green plants. And the massive extinction of green plants may lead to famine and immense death of all living species including man.</p>
<p>Fertilizers which once provided a sufficient amount of the essential nitrates to plants to synthesize&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">chlorophyll</a>&nbsp;and increase crop growth to feed the growing population and satisfy the demand for food, has now blamed for causing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>hypertrophication</strong></a>&nbsp;i.e., fertilizers left unused in soil are carried away by rain water into lakes and rivers, and then to coastal estuaries and bays. And the overload of fertilizers induces explosive growth of algal blooms, which prevents&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">light</a>&nbsp;from getting into the water and thereby preventing the aquatic plants from photosynthesizing, a process which provides oxygen in the water to animals that need it, like fish and crabs. So, in addition to the lack of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">oxygen</a>&nbsp;from photosynthesis, when algal blooms die they decompose and they are acted upon by microorganisms. And this&nbsp;decomposition process consumes oxygen, which reduces the concentration of dissolved oxygen. And the depleted oxygen levels in turn lead to fish kills and a range of other effects promoting the loss of species&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">biodiversity</a>. And the large scale&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_natural_resources" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">exploitation</a>&nbsp;of forests for industrialization and residential purposes has not only led to the loss of biodiversity but has led the diseases like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AIDS</a>&nbsp;(<strong>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome&nbsp;</strong>caused by a virus called&nbsp;<strong>HIV</strong>&nbsp;(Human immunodeficiency virus) which alters the immune system, making victim much more vulnerable to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">infection</a>s and diseases) to transmit from forests to cities.</p>
<p>At the dawn of the early century, the entire world was thoroughly wedded to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fossil</a>&nbsp;fuels in the form of oil,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>natural gas</strong></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">coal</a>&nbsp;to satisfy the demand for energy. And as a result, fossil fuels were becoming increasingly rare and were slowly dooming to extinction. In that period, science (upon the work of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Curie</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Einstein</a>) introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">nuclear fission</a>&nbsp;reaction (the process by which a heavy nucleus breaks down into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing energy.&nbsp;<strong>For example:</strong>&nbsp;if we hit a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">uranium</a>-235 nucleus with a neutron, it split into a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">krypton</a>&nbsp;nucleus, a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>barium</strong></a>&nbsp;nucleus, three&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">neutron</a>s, and energy) as an alternate to the world&rsquo;s energy supply and therefore prevented the world&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">economy</a>&nbsp;from coming to a grinding halt. But at the same time science introduced nuclear fission reaction to produce thousands of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">nuclear weapon</a>s, which were dropped on all the cities in World War II amounted to some two million tons,&nbsp;<strong>two megatons</strong>, of TNT, which flattened heavily reinforced buildings many kilometers away, the firestorm, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gamma ray</a>s and the thermal neutrons, which effectively fried the people. A&nbsp;<strong>school girl</strong>&nbsp;who survived the nuclear attack on Hiroshima, the event that ended the Second World War, wrote this first-hand account:</p>
<p>"Through a darkness like the&nbsp;<strong>bottom of hell</strong>, I could hear the voices of the other students calling for their mothers. And at the base of the bridge, inside a big cistern that had been dug out there, was a mother weeping, holding above her head a naked baby that was burned red all over its body. And another mother was crying and&nbsp;<strong>sobbing</strong>&nbsp;as she gave her burned breast to her baby. In the&nbsp;<strong>cistern</strong>&nbsp;the students stood with only their heads above the water, and their two hands, which they clasped as they&nbsp;<strong>imploringly cried and screamed</strong>, calling for their parents. But every single person who passed was wounded, all of them, and there was no one, there was no one to turn to for help. And the&nbsp;<strong>singed hair</strong>&nbsp;on the heads of the people was frizzled and whitish and covered with dust. They did not appear to be human, not creatures of this world."</p>
<p>Nuclear breakthroughs have now turned out to be the biggest existential threat to human survival.&nbsp;<strong>Nuclear waste</strong>&nbsp;is banking up at every single nuclear site. And as a result, every nation is suffering from a massive case of nuclear constipation (that Causes Intractable Chronic&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Constipation</a>&nbsp;in Children).</p>
<p>Ninety-one percent of&nbsp;<strong>world adults</strong>&nbsp;and 60 percent of teens own this device that has revolutionized the most indispensable accessories of professional and social life. Science once introduced this device for wireless communication but now they are pointed to as a possible cause of everything from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">infertility</a>&nbsp;to cancer to other&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">health</a>&nbsp;issues. And in a study conducted at the&nbsp;<strong>University of London</strong>, researchers sampled 390 cell phones to measure for levels of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">pathogen</a>ic bacteria. The results of the study showed that 92 percent of the cell phones sampled&nbsp;had heavily colonized by high quantities of various types of disease-prone bacteria with high resistances to commonly used&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">antibiotic</a>s (around 25,000&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>bacteria</strong></a>&nbsp;per square inch) and the results concluded that their ability to transmit diseases of which the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mobile phone</a>s are no exception. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fluoridation of water&nbsp;</a>at optimal levels has been shown to be highly beneficial to the development of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tooth enamel</a>&nbsp;and prevention of&nbsp;<strong>dental cavities</strong>since the late 1800s. And studies showed that children who drink water fluoridated at optimal levels can experience 20 to 40 per cent less tooth decay. But now fluoridation of water has termed to cause lower IQ,&nbsp;<strong>memory loss</strong>, cancer, kidney stones &amp; kidney failures &ndash; faster than any other chemical.</p>
<p>Science once introduced irradiation to prevent food poisoning by destroying&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mold" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mold</a>s, bacteria (such as one &ndash; celled animal '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Amoeba</strong></a>' &ndash; that have as much&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">information</a>&nbsp;in their&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DNA</a>&nbsp;as 1,000&nbsp;<strong>Encyclopedia Britannicas&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; which is almost unbelievably minute form of life which, after being cut into six separate parts, is able to produce six complete bodies to carry on as though nothing had happened),&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">yeast</a>&nbsp;and virus (the smallest living things which cannot reproduce itself unaided and therefore it is lifeless in the true sense. But when placed in the plasma of a living&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cell&nbsp;</a>and, in&nbsp;<strong>forty eight minutes</strong>&nbsp;it can reproduce itself four hundred times) and control microbial&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">infestation</a>. But now it has been blamed to cause the loss of nutrients, for example&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">vitamin E</a>&nbsp;levels can be reduced by 25% after irradiation and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">vitamin C</a>&nbsp;by 5-10% and damage food by breaking up molecules and creating free radicals. And these free<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;radical</a>s combine with existing chemicals (like&nbsp;<strong>preservatives</strong>) in the food to produce deadly toxins. This has caused some food manufacturers to limit or avoid the process and bills have even been introduced to ban irradiated foods in public&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafeteria" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cafeteria</a>s or to require irradiated food to carry sensational warning labels. And the rapid advancement of science combined with&nbsp;<strong>human aggression</strong>&nbsp;and aim for global supremacy has led even the smaller nations to weaponize&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">anthrax</a>&nbsp;spores and other viruses for maximum death and destruction. And thus the entire planet is gripped with fear that one day a&nbsp;<strong>terrorist</strong>&nbsp;group may pay to gain access to weaponized&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>H5N1 flu</strong></a>&nbsp;and other viruses. And the enormous automation, capacity of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>artificial intelligence</strong></a>&nbsp;and their ability to interact like humans has caused the humans to be replaced by artificial intelligence. But now artificial intelligence is taking off on its own, and re-designing itself at an ever increasing rate. And this has turned out to be the biggest existential threat to&nbsp;<strong>human survival</strong>&nbsp;(i.e., one day artificial intelligence may plan for a war against humanity). Highly toxic gases, poisons, defoliants, and every technological state are planning for it to disable or destroy people or their domestic animals, to damage their crops, and/or to deteriorate their supplies, threaten every&nbsp;<strong>citizen</strong>, not just of a nation, but of the world.&nbsp;</p>
